"""Pure key-decision state machine for PromptInput. No Textual imports — the
widget passes a snapshot (KeyContext) and applies the returned action. This is
the single authority for key priority: panel (while visible) > history browse >
plain edit. The widget only executes the side effect for whatever action it
returns; it does not re-decide priority itself."""
