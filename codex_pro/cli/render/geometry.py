"""Fixed indentation for the inline renderer's two-level output.

Three constants replace four interacting mechanisms the Textual transcript
needs (app.tcss padding, turn_layout.rail_prefix, blocks.child_rail, and a
focus-state border compensated by negative padding). The reason they can be
constants here is that nothing is ever re-rendered: a line's prefix is decided
when it is printed and the printed bytes never move again. That also removes
the "which trace line is last" question that forced turn_layout to give up on
├─/└─ between blocks while blocks.child_rail still used them inside a block —
the inconsistency this geometry retires.

Scope constraint — ``CODEX_TUI_ICONS=claude`` belongs to this renderer only, and
is not a legal value for the full-screen TUI. The CLAUDE glyph set sets ``rail``
and ``branch`` to empty strings, which is right for a renderer that draws no
tree, but it breaks a geometry invariant the full-screen path depends on:
blocks.child_rail aligns a wrapped detail line with ``cont.ljust(len(elbow))``,
i.e. it assumes the elbow and the rail have the same width. With CLAUDE that
padding target collapses to 0 for a non-last row and 2 for a last row instead of
the uniform 3 every other set yields, so continuation lines land in the wrong
column (measured: 4 failures in tests/cli/tui/ under that env var, 0 on the
baseline sets). The inline renderer is immune because its indentation comes from
the constants below and never routes through ``turn_layout.rail_prefix`` or
``blocks.child_rail``; only ``branch_last`` is read, and only for its width.
