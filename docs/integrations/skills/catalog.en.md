    It runs several rounds of search and page fetching, so a single invocation can consume tens of times the tokens of an ordinary exchange. The skill itself neither estimates usage nor imposes a cap.

    Constrain it from the cost side instead: `cost.dailyBudgetUsd` sets a hard daily ceiling (reaching it refuses further calls) and `cost.softThresholdRatio` warns at a fraction of it. After the fact, `codex-pro cost` breaks spending down by model. See [cost control](../../guides/cost-control.en.md).
