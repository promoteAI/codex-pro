"""Per-job unattended-execution authorization.

A cron job may only run WRITE/EXEC tools with no human present if a human
authorized *this* job's content. Authorization used to be inferred from a
missing payload key defaulting to True, which meant any caller able to create a
job also granted itself that permission. It is now an explicit first-class
field on ScheduledJob, bound to the job's content by a fingerprint.

Binding it to a fingerprint is what makes "editing a job revokes its
authorization" a property rather than a rule each write path must remember to
enforce: the instruction, the delivery target and the firing schedule all feed
the hash, so changing any of them invalidates the grant automatically.

`name` and `enabled` are deliberately excluded. Renaming a job, or pausing and
resuming one whose content never changed, does not change what a human
consented to. The dangerous path — pause, edit the instruction, resume — is
already covered by the instruction hash.
