"""Re-authorizing an EXISTING scheduled job from a chat channel.

`grant()` had four callers — cronjob's `create`, the CLI, and the REST
POST/PUT — and only the first can be reached from a chat channel. It fires once,
at creation. Everything after that (a job stored before the authorization
contract, a job whose fingerprint an edit invalidated, a grant the dashboard
revoked) had no chat-reachable path back to authorized, because:

  * `codex-pro cron authorize` refuses outright while the gateway holds the
    instance lock (cron_cmd._gateway_is_running), which is exactly when a chat
    user is talking to the agent;
  * the REST endpoint and the dashboard are not reachable from inside a
    conversation.

So the denial produced by _resolve_unattended pointed a chat user at two paths
they cannot take, and the tool offered no third one. These tests span
tool schema → approval gate → grant → delivery, which is the only place where
"a chat user can authorize an existing job" is a testable claim.

Config is built explicitly rather than via load_config(): the shipped defaults
are what make this path interesting (personal_cli + cli_auto_approve), and a
machine-local yaml would decide the outcome instead of the code.
