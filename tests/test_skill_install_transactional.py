"""Tests for transactional skill installs and binary asset support.

The installer used to create the skill, then copy support files one by one with
``read_text``. Any binary asset (PNG, font) raised UnicodeDecodeError partway
through, and nothing rolled back — leaving a half-installed skill that showed up
in skills_list but could not run. Same for the file-count limit: "error, but 2000
files already copied".

Also covered: name overrides now rewrite the frontmatter (a skill installed as
``my-alias`` used to still be *listed* as ``original-name``, answer to both, and
collide with a real ``original-name``), and subdirectory containment.
