"""send_file tool — send a local file or image to a specific channel/chat.

Mirrors MessageTool: a thin wrapper that publishes an OutboundEvent. The actual
upload/transport is handled by the channel adapter (e.g. weixin uploads to the
WeChat CDN). The tool only resolves and validates the local path, then routes a
structured FILE/IMAGE content block onto the bus.
