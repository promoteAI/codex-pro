"""Codex Pro lazy dependency management.

Provides on-demand installation of optional Python packages required by
individual skills. Skills declare their dependencies in SKILL.md frontmatter
(metadata.codex.requires), and this module ensures those packages are available
at runtime — installing them into the active venv with user confirmation when
needed.
