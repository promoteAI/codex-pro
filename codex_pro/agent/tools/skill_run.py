"""skill_run — execute a skill's script in the agent's own interpreter.

Skills are documented in SKILL.md as a fixed bundle of file operations, but
their **scripts** are runnable Python that depends on optional packages
(duckduckgo_search, trafilatura, …). Without a single chokepoint they were
executed via the shell tool, which:

* resolved ``python3`` against the shell's PATH — not the venv the agent
  itself uses (the gap executor.base.prepend_interpreter_bin now closes
  for the shell tool, but does not change anything the model wrote by hand),
* ran from the workspace cwd rather than the skill's directory, so a script
  that opens ``./templates/foo.json`` looks in the wrong place,
* bypassed the skill-script dependency handshake entirely — a skill whose
  SKILL.md declares ``requires.pip`` is no different from one that does not.

This tool makes running a skill script a deliberate, gated operation: the
interpreter and cwd are pinned, declared dependencies are resolved first,
the model gets structured output, and the same approval gate other EXEC
tools go through still applies.
