    capability decisions elsewhere — ``channels.stream_optimistic_channels``
    asserts "this channel can redraw text it already showed" — so an unconstrained
    value would let any caller claim a first-party client's capabilities and be
    served draft retractions it cannot honour.

    Unknown values fold to ``ws`` instead of being rejected: existing third-party
    callers post arbitrary platform strings and rejecting them buys no safety that
    the fold does not already provide. An empty/missing ``known`` list disables
    folding entirely, restoring the legacy fully-self-reported behaviour for
    anyone who needs it.

    This is deliberately NOT an identity control — two clients may report the
    same platform. Impersonation is handled by :func:`resolve_client_session_key`.
