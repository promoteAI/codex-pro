"""Environment construction for skill script subprocesses.

``skill_run`` used to launch scripts with ``env={}``. The intent was sound —
don't hand a skill the agent's whole environment — but an *empty* env is not a
smaller environment, it is a broken one:

* No ``PATH``, so ``shutil.which("docker")`` returns None. Every skill
  declaring ``requires.bins`` was unrunnable, making that field decoration.
* No ``HOME``, so anything touching ``~/.config`` or a cache dir failed in
  ways whose traceback pointed nowhere near the real cause.
* No credentials, so ``image-gen`` (reads ``OPENAI_API_KEY``) exited on start.
  The documented workaround was to pass secrets through ``args`` — which puts
  them in the audit log and in ``ps`` output. The safe-looking default was
  actively pushing users toward the unsafe pattern.

So: an allowlist, not a blank slate and not ``os.environ``. Infrastructure keys
below are passed through unconditionally; credentials only when the skill names
them in ``metadata.codex.requires.env``, so reading a SKILL.md tells you exactly
which secrets it can see.
