"""Local cross-encoder reranker — fastembed TextCrossEncoder (ONNX, CPU).

The hybrid retriever fuses BM25 + vector rankings with RRF, which is purely
rank-based: it fuses the ORDER of two signals but has no notion of how relevant
a candidate actually is to the query. A cross-encoder scores each (query, doc)
pair jointly and is the precision gold standard for "is this actually relevant".
Running it over the small fused top-K (not the whole store) is cheap and turns
"best of whatever ranked" into "best of what's genuinely on-topic".

Same operational contract as LocalEmbedder: lazy load (first use may download
the model), load + inference both on a dedicated single-thread pool so the event
loop never blocks, a per-call wait budget that degrades THIS turn (keep the RRF
order) on timeout while the download continues, and bounded backoff on genuine
load failure. rerank() returns None on any failure so the caller degrades to the
un-reranked order rather than dropping recall.

# fastembed's local_files_only load hits it. Verified offline before shipping.

# ~941 MiB, so the CN-friendly mirror can only host it as parts — which is why a
# parts source exists at all, and why it must be verified AFTER joining (the
# pinned sha256 is the whole tarball's, individual volumes have no digest).
