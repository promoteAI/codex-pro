"""One turn must not deliver two final messages to the same target.

Observed as a cron weather job posting twice to WeChat at 06:30, with *different*
content each time — so not the known iLinkAI retry (which duplicates verbatim).
The two messages came from two different places:

  1. the `message` tool delivering the report the job asked for, and
  2. the turn's own final reply — a "✅ 已推送" wrap-up written for the caller,
     not for the user — delivered by loop.py because nothing told it the report
     had already gone out.

Three facts combined to allow it:

  - OutboundEvent defaults to is_final=True / message_kind="final", so a tool's
    own event is treated exactly like a turn's final answer;
  - the tools published without `_inbound_event_id`, so their message belonged to
    no turn and could not be related to the reply that followed;
  - `_finalized_keys` — commented as the "authoritative finalize guard" — was
    only ever written by _deliver_final and read by _handle_heartbeat. It guarded
    "a late heartbeat must not overwrite the answer" and nothing else.

The guard now also records which targets a turn has delivered to, and suppresses
the turn's own reply to a target a tool already delivered to. Suppression is
per-target and one-directional on purpose; the tests below pin both limits.
