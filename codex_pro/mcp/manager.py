"""MCP manager — orchestrates multiple MCP server connections and tool registration.

Owns the whole lifecycle of every configured MCP server: connect (with retry),
discover and register its tools, watch the connection, and on loss unregister
those tools and rebuild from scratch. The invariant it exists to hold is that
**the registry advertises a tool only while that tool is actually callable** —
the previous version registered tools once and never revisited the decision, so
a server that died left its tools listed and every call failed.
