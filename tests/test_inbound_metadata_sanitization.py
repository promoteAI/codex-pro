"""Regression: inbound metadata must not carry internal control keys.

Internal control flags are namespaced with a leading underscore
(_unattended, _cron_authorized, _drop, ...). Some of them gate the approval
path: an event with {"_unattended": True, "_cron_authorized": True} makes the
approval gate treat an EXEC call as a per-job-authorized unattended cron run and
lets it through even under unattended_policy="deny".

External channels receive metadata from untrusted callers (a webhook JSON body,
an IM payload). base._build_event is the single choke point every external
channel routes through, and it strips the "_" namespace so a caller-supplied
"_cron_authorized" can never reach the gate. Trusted internal producers
(scheduler/delivery.py, cron.py) construct InboundEvent directly and keep their
flags — those paths are exercised by test_approval_gate_e2e.py.
