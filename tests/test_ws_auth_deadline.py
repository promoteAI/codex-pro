# tests/test_ws_auth_deadline.py
"""The pre-auth bound is absolute, not a per-frame idle timeout.

Both WS endpoints wrapped each `receive()` in `wait_for(..., AUTH_TIMEOUT)`, which
restarts its clock on every frame. What that enforces is "N seconds of silence",
not "N seconds to authenticate": a peer that keeps sending frames it is not
entitled to send renews its own deadline forever. On the dashboard endpoint that
holds one of only MAX_UNAUTHENTICATED_CLIENTS slots, so eight chattering peers
deny the dashboard to everyone.

test_ws_auth_timeout.py has a test named for this case, but it cannot detect the
bug: it sends a single frame and then waits, so the reset it would have to catch
never gets exercised twice. These tests keep talking for longer than the budget.
