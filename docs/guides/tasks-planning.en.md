# Tasks & Planning

Codex Pro provides full task lifecycle management: from lightweight Todo lists to DAG-driven multi-step Workflows, to multi-agent delegation via the delegate tool. All tasks are unified on Codex Pro Kanban board with real-time monitoring and manual intervention support.

---

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Tool | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Todo** | `todo` | Lightweight task list, per-session storage, ideal for planning-phase brainstorming |
| **Task** | `task` | Persistent task records with full state machine, priority, and Kanban tracking |
| **Workflow** | `workflow` | DAG-based multi-step orchestration with automatic dependency resolution |
| **Delegate** | `delegate` | Multi-agent dispatch — the main Agent splits sub-tasks for parallel worker execution |

---

## Task State Machine

The core of Task management is a strict finite state machine. All transitions are validated.

### State Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Terminal |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `PENDING` | Created, awaiting queue entry | |
| `QUEUED` | Queued, awaiting execution | |
| `RUNNING` | Currently executing | |
| `BLOCKED` | Blocked by external dependency | |
| `REVIEW` | Execution complete, awaiting review | |
| `SUSPENDED` | Manually suspended | |
| `SUCCESS` | Completed successfully | Yes |
| `FAILED` | Execution failed | Yes |
| `CANCELLED` | Cancelled | Yes |

### State Transition Diagram

```
PENDING ──→ QUEUED ──→ RUNNING ──→ REVIEW ──→ SUCCESS
  │            │          │  │  │               │
  │            │          │  │  └→ SUSPENDED    │
  │            │          │  └──→ BLOCKED       │
  │            │          └────→ FAILED         │
  │            │                    │           │
  │            ←────────────────────┘ (retry)   │
  │            ←────────────────────────────────┘ (reject → re-queue)
  │            ←──── BLOCKED (unblock)
  │            ←──── SUSPENDED (resume)
  └──→ CANCELLED ← (reachable from any non-terminal state)
```

### Valid Transitions Table

```python
VALID_TASK_TRANSITIONS = {
    PENDING:   {QUEUED, CANCELLED},
    QUEUED:    {RUNNING, CANCELLED},
    RUNNING:   {REVIEW, BLOCKED, FAILED, SUSPENDED, CANCELLED},
    BLOCKED:   {QUEUED, RUNNING, CANCELLED},
    REVIEW:    {SUCCESS, QUEUED},
    SUSPENDED: {QUEUED, RUNNING, CANCELLED},
    FAILED:    {QUEUED},         # retry
    SUCCESS:   {},               # terminal
    CANCELLED: {},               # terminal
}
```

!!! warning "State Transition Rules"
    - Any transition not listed above raises a `ValueError` — TaskManager rejects the operation.
    - When the Agent calls `task complete`, the tool internally performs the two-step `RUNNING → REVIEW → SUCCESS` transition automatically; no manual REVIEW step is needed.
    - `FAILED → QUEUED` is the only retry path. Each retry increments `retry_count`; once `max_retries` is exceeded, retry is no longer allowed.

---

## Task Lifecycle

### Creating a Task

```json
{"tool": "task", "action": "create", "title": "Crawl documentation", "priority": 3}
```

New tasks start in `PENDING` status with an auto-generated unique ID (format: `t_xxxxxxxxxxxx`).

### Starting and Executing

```json
{"tool": "task", "action": "start", "task_id": "t_abc123"}
```

Status flows through `PENDING → QUEUED → RUNNING`. The Agent performs actual work while in `RUNNING`.

### Completing or Failing

```json
{"tool": "task", "action": "complete", "task_id": "t_abc123", "result": "Crawled 42 documents"}
{"tool": "task", "action": "fail", "task_id": "t_abc123", "error": "Target site returned 503"}
```

### Retrying

```json
{"tool": "task", "action": "retry", "task_id": "t_abc123"}
```

Re-queues a `FAILED` task, incrementing `retry_count` by 1.

### Blocked and Suspended

- **BLOCKED**: Task cannot proceed due to an external dependency. Set `blocked_reason` to explain why.
- **SUSPENDED**: Manually paused. Can be resumed to `QUEUED` or `RUNNING` at any time.

## Workflow Orchestration

Workflow is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based multi-step orchestration engine. Each step defines its dependencies; the engine automatically resolves topological order and schedules ready steps.

### Workflow State Machine

```
PENDING ──→ RUNNING ──→ SUCCESS
  │            │  │
  │            │  └→ WAITING (paused, awaiting)
  │            │  └→ BLOCKED
  │            └──→ FAILED ──→ PENDING (retry whole workflow)
  └──→ CANCELLED ← (reachable from any non-terminal state)
```

### Creating a Workflow

```json
{
  "tool": "workflow",
  "action": "create",
  "name": "Data processing pipeline",
  "steps": [
    {"id": "fetch", "name": "Fetch data", "tool_name": "http_get", "tool_params": {"url": "..."}},
    {"id": "parse", "name": "Parse data", "tool_name": "extract", "tool_params": {}, "depends_on": ["fetch"]},
    {"id": "store", "name": "Store results", "tool_name": "db_write", "tool_params": {}, "depends_on": ["parse"]}
  ]
}
```

### StepDefinition Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Step ID (auto-generated as `step_0`, `step_1`... if not specified) |
| `name` | string | Step name |
| `tool_name` | string | Tool to execute |
| `tool_params` | dict | Tool parameters |
| `depends_on` | list[str] | List of dependency step IDs |
| `condition` | string | Condition expression (reserved) |
| `retry_max` | int | Step-level retry limit |
| `timeout_seconds` | int | Timeout in seconds, default 300 |

### Execution Model

The Workflow engine **only orchestrates** — it resolves dependencies, creates step tasks, and advances state, but **does not execute tools**. Actual execution is performed by the Agent:

1. `workflow start` → engine creates `QUEUED` tasks for steps with no dependencies
2. Agent discovers ready step tasks via `task list` (`metadata` contains `tool_name`/`tool_params`)
3. Agent executes: `task start` → run the tool → `task complete`
4. `task complete` automatically triggers `workflow.advance()`, engine checks dependencies and schedules subsequent steps
5. All steps succeed → workflow status becomes `SUCCESS`; any step fails → workflow becomes `FAILED`

!!! note "advance is best-effort, not part of the transaction"
    Both `task complete` and `task fail` trigger one advance *after* the state has been persisted; `task cancel` does not.

    Persisting the task state and advancing the workflow are two separate steps, and the first completes first. A failed advance only logs a warning — it does not fail the tool call and does not roll back the task state. The cost is that DAG progress stalls where it is until the next explicit `workflow advance`. There is no background compensation job covering this.

    So a workflow that has not progressed for a while is worth checking with `workflow status`: a task in a terminal state while the workflow still sits on an older step means an advance was dropped.

### Workflow Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `start` | Start the workflow, schedule ready steps |
| `status` | View workflow current state and step progress |
| `advance` | Manual advance (normal flow auto-advances; use this for manual recovery) |
| `pause` | Pause workflow (status → WAITING) |
| `resume` | Resume workflow, re-schedule ready steps |
| `cancel` | Cancel workflow and all its incomplete step tasks |
| `list` | List all workflows, optionally filter by status |

---

## Todo Tool

`todo` is a lightweight task list tool with data stored per-session in local JSON files. Ideal for the Agent to organize thoughts and break down steps during the planning phase.

### Operations

```json
{"tool": "todo", "action": "create", "title": "Research competitor APIs"}
{"tool": "todo", "action": "create", "items": [
  {"title": "Step 1: Read configuration"},
  {"title": "Step 2: Validate parameters"},
  {"title": "Step 3: Execute migration"}
]}
{"tool": "todo", "action": "list"}
{"tool": "todo", "action": "update", "task_id": "t_abc123", "status": "in_progress"}
{"tool": "todo", "action": "complete", "task_id": "t_abc123"}
{"tool": "todo", "action": "delete", "task_id": "t_abc123"}
```

### Todo vs Task

| Dimension | Todo | Task |
|-----------|------|------|
| Persistence | Local JSON, session-scoped | Database-persisted |
| State machine | `pending` / `in_progress` / `done` | 9-state strict state machine |
| Kanban | Not shown on Kanban | Displayed on Codex Pro Kanban |
| Workflow | Not supported | Supported as workflow step |
| Use case | Planning, thinking, temporary lists | Formal task tracking and scheduling |

---

## Multi-Agent Delegation

The `delegate` tool allows the main Agent (orchestrator) to dispatch sub-tasks to Worker Agents for parallel execution.

### Invocation

```json
{
  "tool": "delegate",
  "task": "Translate README into Japanese",
  "context": "README.md at the project root, preserve formatting"
}
```

### Execution Model

1. Main Agent calls `delegate`, describing the sub-task and context
2. System creates a Worker Agent with a restricted tool set (excludes `delegate`/`spawn_task`/`clarify`, etc.)
3. Worker executes independently, bounded by `max_iterations` and `timeout_seconds`
4. Worker returns structured results to the main Agent
5. Main Agent synthesizes Worker results and continues

### Security Constraints

- Workers cannot call `delegate` (prevents recursive dispatch storms)
- Workers cannot message the user directly (`message`/`notify` are blocked)
- Worker tool calls are subject to the same approval policies as the main Agent
- Each Worker has an independent `trace_id` for audit tracking

!!! info "Risk Level"
    The `delegate` tool has `risk_level` set to `exec`, meaning it performs actual operations. In channels requiring approval, the dispatch itself must pass through the approval gate first.

## Kanban Board

### Codex Pro Kanban Page

Codex Pro provides a visual Kanban board with tasks organized by status columns:

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ PENDING │ QUEUED  │ RUNNING │ REVIEW  │ BLOCKED │ FAILED  │
├─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│ Card    │ Card    │ Card    │ Card    │         │ Card    │
│ Card    │         │ Card    │         │         │         │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

### Board Features

- **Persistent columns**: PENDING, QUEUED, RUNNING, REVIEW, BLOCKED, FAILED are always visible
- **Terminal archiving**: SUCCESS and CANCELLED tasks are hidden from the main view (toggle to view)
- **Card information**: Title, priority, labels, assignee, source, blocked reason
- **Status colors**: Each status has a distinct visual color scheme
- **Drag-and-drop**: Supports dragging cards to change status within valid transitions
- **Board isolation**: Multiple boards via `board_id`, default board ID is `"default"`

### API Access

```
GET  /api/tasks?board_id=default
GET  /api/tasks?status=running
POST /api/tasks/{id}/transition  {"status": "queued"}
```

---

## Priority & Configuration

### Priority System

Priority ranges from 0-9, lower numbers indicate higher priority:

| Range | Meaning | Use Case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 0-2 | Urgent | Direct user commands, blocking issues |
| 3-4 | High | Important features, time-sensitive tasks |
| 5 | Default | Regular tasks |
| 6-7 | Low | Optimizations, non-urgent improvements |
| 8-9 | Lowest | Background cleanup, experimental tasks |

### Concurrency & Retry

- `max_retries`: Maximum retry count, default 3
- `retry_count`: Number of retries attempted, incremented on each `retry` operation
- Optimistic locking (`version` field + CAS): Prevents concurrent update conflicts
- Lease mechanism (`lease_until_ms`): Prevents tasks stuck in RUNNING permanently after Worker crashes

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Task Tracking

```
User: Fix this bug for me
Agent:
  → task create "Fix login page 500 error" priority=2
  → task start
  → (performs the fix)
  → task complete result="Fixed null pointer exception, added tests"
```

### Example 2: Multi-Step Pipeline

```
Agent:
  → workflow create "Deploy pipeline" steps=[
      {id: "test", tool_name: "shell", tool_params: {cmd: "pytest"}},
      {id: "build", tool_name: "shell", tool_params: {cmd: "docker build"}, depends_on: ["test"]},
      {id: "deploy", tool_name: "shell", tool_params: {cmd: "kubectl apply"}, depends_on: ["build"]}
    ]
  → workflow start
  → (engine auto-schedules test → build → deploy)
```

### Example 3: Parallel Delegation

```
Agent:
  → delegate task="Translate CHANGELOG into Japanese"
  → delegate task="Translate CHANGELOG into Korean"
  → (two Workers execute in parallel, main Agent synthesizes results)
```

### Example 4: Planning Phase with Todo

```
Agent:
  → todo create items=[
      {title: "Analyze existing data model"},
      {title: "Design new API interfaces"},
      {title: "Write migration script"},
      {title: "Write test cases"}
    ]
  → (execute step by step, marking complete)
  → todo complete task_id="t_xxx"
```
