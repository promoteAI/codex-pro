# ── P1-03 delivery ledger regression fence ─────────────────────────────────
#
# Two distinct bugs the old ledger had:
#
#   (a) The approval prompt — built by ApprovalGate via text_reply — inherited
#       the default is_final=True / message_kind="final", so it claimed the
#       delivery target. The user's real answer after /approve was suppressed
#       as a duplicate, leaving them staring at the prompt with no follow-up.
#
#   (b) The target was written into _finalized_targets BEFORE awaiting
#       channel.send, so a transient transport failure claimed the target
#       anyway. Every later retry of the same turn's answer was then suppressed
#       as a duplicate — even though nothing had ever been delivered.
#
# These tests pin both shapes. The ``approval_prompt`` event is routed past
# ``_deliver_final`` entirely; failures leave the target unclaimed so the
# retry has room to try.
