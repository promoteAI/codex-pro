"""In-memory ring buffer for recent log records.

The dashboard's ``/api/v1/logs`` endpoint reads structured log entries from
here. loguru itself only fans out to sinks (stderr, files); it keeps no queryable
history. We attach a sink that appends a compact dict per record to a bounded
deque, so the API can page/filter recent logs without touching disk.

The buffer is process-global (a single deque) rather than per-``AgentLoop``:
loguru sinks are registered on the one process-wide ``logger``, so binding the
buffer to an instance would leak records across instances and across tests. A
single module-level buffer with an idempotent installer keeps ownership clear.
