"""Restart circuit breaker — suppress watchdog self-exits during a respawn storm.

The loop watchdog self-exits so a supervisor (launchd KeepAlive / systemd
Restart=always) respawns a clean process. But if the freeze recurs immediately
on every restart, that becomes a tight kill/respawn loop. This guard records
each self-exit to a small JSON file with a rolling time window; once the count
in the window exceeds ``max_restarts``, ``is_tripped()`` returns True and the
watchdog refuses to arm — pulling a human into the loop instead of thrashing.

Uses wall-clock time.time() intentionally: the window must survive across
process restarts, so a monotonic clock (which resets each process) is unusable.
