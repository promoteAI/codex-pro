"""Glyph set for transcript decoration, selectable by ``CODEX_TUI_ICONS``.

The transcript used to hard-code emoji (🔧 🧠 💭 ⏳ ✍ 🧬 ⚠️ 💰) as its line
markers. Emoji are double-width in some terminals and single-width in others —
and the VS16 variation selector on ⚠️/✍ makes even one terminal inconsistent
between them — so every marked line started at a different column and the
transcript never aligned. They also all read at the same visual weight, which
is exactly wrong: a tool trace should recede behind the answer.

The default set is therefore narrow, single-column geometry: ``●`` for actors,
``✓``/``✗`` for outcomes, ``▸``/``▾`` for disclosure, ``├─ └─ │`` for tree
rails. Colour (not glyph) carries the semantics, which is what lets a trace line
be quiet. ``CODEX_TUI_ICONS=emoji`` restores the old pictographs for users who
prefer them; ``ascii`` drops to pure 7-bit for terminals without the box glyphs.

Pure module (env read once at import, overridable via ``resolve_glyphs``) so
widgets can be unit-tested against any set without a live screen.
