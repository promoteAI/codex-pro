"""Bind-address / Host-header classification — the rules four callers share.

Before ``gateway/host_rules.py`` existed, each caller answered "is this bind
local?" on its own and they disagreed on exactly the values that matter. Two of
those disagreements were bugs with teeth:

* ``host: ""`` counted as loopback in ``_check_bind_safety`` and in the wizard,
  so an unauthenticated gateway was allowed to start on what is actually a
  wildcard bind (aiohttp binds "" to 0.0.0.0 *and* ::) — an unauthenticated
  network exposure.
* ``allowed_hosts`` was compared verbatim, so a pasted ``host:port``, a
  capitalized domain or a bare ``::1`` produced an allowlist that silently
  matched nothing.

These tests pin the rules themselves. The parity between the rules and each
caller is pinned separately (see test_setup_gateway_start.py and
test_gateway_default_startable.py).
