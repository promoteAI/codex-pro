"""Stateless model context-window resolution.

The context window (max input+output tokens a model accepts) is what the CLI
gauge shows as "max" and what the compressor uses to decide when to compress.
Providers do not report their own window on a response, so this module resolves
it from a layered set of sources, mirroring cost/pricing.py's prefix-match
registry pattern.

Resolution order (highest priority first):
  1. route/provider explicit override  (route_override, user knows best)
  2. setup-captured API metadata        (captured_windows, per-model)
  3. models.dev live catalog            (4000+ models, cached; blank on cold start)
  4. built-in registry                  (prefix match, ships with the app)
  5. global config default              (config_default) — only an explicit,
     non-zero user setting; a 0/unset default falls through so an unknown model
     lands on the honest 256K baseline instead of an arbitrary small number
  6. hard fallback DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOW

The models.dev layer never blocks: it reads a background-refreshed cache and
returns 0 (fall through to the registry) until the cache is warm. Nothing here
mutates state; callers decide what to do with the number.
