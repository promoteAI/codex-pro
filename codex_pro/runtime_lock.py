"""Workspace-scoped single-instance lock.

Guarantees that at most one channel-consuming agent process runs per workspace.
Without it, a background service (``codex-pro gateway``) and a foreground
``codex-pro run`` against the same workspace both start their channel pollers,
so every inbound message is consumed — and answered — twice. The workspace is
the right scope because it is the shared root for the SQLite database, the
scheduler state and the memory store; one lock there protects all of them.

The authority is the OS advisory lock, never the file contents: an ``flock``
(POSIX) / ``msvcrt`` (Windows) lock is released automatically when the holding
process dies, so a crash never leaves a stale lock behind — unlike a bare
pidfile, which would need liveness + start-time reconciliation to clean up. The
pid / start_time / role written into the file are for human diagnostics only.
