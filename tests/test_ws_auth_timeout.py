# tests/test_ws_auth_timeout.py
"""The main WS must not hold an unauthenticated socket open indefinitely.

The endpoint had an Origin gate and a heartbeat but no bound on the pre-auth
window: authentication is the first frame of the message loop, so a peer that
connected and never sent an `auth` frame kept its connection slot for as long
as it cared to. These tests pin the bound *and* the other half of the contract —
an authenticated client may idle as long as it likes, because a TUI turn can
run far longer than the pre-auth timeout.

Reuses the `gateway_ws_url` fixture from conftest (a real open-mode
GatewayServer on loopback), so the whole handshake path is exercised.
