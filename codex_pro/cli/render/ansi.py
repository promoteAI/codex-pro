"""24-bit ANSI painting for the inline renderer.

Colour policy is NOT reimplemented here: cli/colors.py already resolves the
three-way decision (explicit override > NO_COLOR > isatty), and the setup
wizard and every --json path already drive it. This module adds the palette
lookup and a paint() that degrades to plain text, so a piped or NO_COLOR run
emits no escapes at all.
