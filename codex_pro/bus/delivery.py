"""Delivery receipt value objects: track an outbound event's real fate.

A published outbound event is not the same as a delivered one. This module
lets publish_outbound report which stage delivery actually reached so that
cron jobs / background tasks / HTTP waits stop reporting success for messages
that never left the process.
