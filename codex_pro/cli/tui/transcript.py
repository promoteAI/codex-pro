        Settles tool lines whose paired "done" frame will now never arrive: they
        stayed rendered as a running "…" line, indistinguishable from a command
        still executing. Streamed thinking lines are settled for the same reason:
        a partial snapshot's closing frame comes from the same dead turn, so
        without this the line keeps claiming "思考中" indefinitely.

        Deliberately NOT called on the normal reply path. The gateway splits one
        answer across several ``is_final`` frames, so a final can arrive while
        tools are still executing — marking those "未完成" would be wrong, and
        dropping their correlation would make the real done frame mount a second,
        duplicate line for the same call.
