"""Shared subprocess lifecycle helpers — process-group isolation and reaping.

Every subprocess we spawn goes through a shell (`/bin/sh -c "<cmd>"`), and a
command may itself fork: pipelines (`a | b`), backgrounded jobs (`x &`), or a
script that spawns its own children. Signalling only the direct child (the sh)
leaves those grandchildren reparented to init as orphans that keep running and
leak RSS.

The fix is three-part and lives here so every spawn site shares one
implementation:

- `spawn_shell()` / `spawn_exec()` start each child in a *new session*, making
  it the leader of its own process group, and record that group id while the
  leader is still alive. The whole tree shares one PGID.
- `terminate_tree()` signals that PGID as a unit (SIGTERM, grace period, then
  SIGKILL) and always reaps the direct child with `wait()`, so nothing lingers
  as a zombie or an orphan. Crucially it sweeps the group even when the leader
  has *already* exited — a shell that backgrounds a job (`sleep 300 &`) exits
  immediately while its grandchild keeps running, so "leader is gone" says
  nothing about whether the tree is gone.
- `communicate_owned()` / `run_owned()` are the async and blocking completion
  primitives for one-shot commands. They preserve the operation's
  result/exception but unconditionally sweep the recorded group, including
  after a successful/non-zero leader exit. Async cleanup is shielded to
  convergence so cancellation cannot abandon the only tree handle.
- `process_group_alive()` answers "is anything still running in this tree?" so
  callers that keep bookkeeping per child (ProcessTool) can tell a genuinely
  finished process from one whose leader merely exited first.

Why the PGID is recorded at spawn instead of looked up on demand: `os.getpgid()`
needs a live, unreaped pid. Once the leader is reaped its pgid is unknowable,
which is exactly the case where background grandchildren survive — so an
on-demand lookup fails at the only moment it matters. With
`start_new_session=True` the group id equals the child's pid by construction, so
recording it at spawn is both cheap and exact.
