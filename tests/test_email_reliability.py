"""Email channel reliability — the three long-standing bugs.

Reviewed issues this pins:

1. ``_send_smtp`` swallowed every exception into a log line. The SMTP
   path returned success even when the message was rejected, so cron
   runs and tasks were marked complete despite the email never going out.

2. ``_fetch_imap`` used ``conn.search(None, "UNSEEN")`` (sequence numbers)
   and stored them as if they were UIDs. Sequence numbers shift on
   EXPUNGE; the in-memory set was the only state, so every restart
   re-fetched every UNSEEN message.

3. The mark-as-processed guard ran *before* ``publish_inbound``. A
   transient bus failure silently dropped the message, and the in-memory
   UID set prevented any retry.
