Both WS endpoints need the same pre-upgrade cross-site gate and the same bound
on how long a socket may stay unauthenticated. The main WS grew its Origin gate
first; the dashboard WS had none and authenticated inside the message loop,
which is after `prepare()` — by then the browser's onopen has fired and a
cross-site page holds a live socket. Keeping both gates in one place is what
stops the two endpoints from drifting apart again.

    — junk, unparseable JSON, `message` before `auth` — renews its own deadline
    indefinitely and keeps holding one of the limited unauthenticated slots.
