"""MCP stdio process-tree reclamation.

The transport spawned the server with ``create_subprocess_exec`` and, on close,
signalled only that direct child. An MCP server is very often a launcher
(``npx``, ``uvx``, a shell wrapper) whose real work runs in a grandchild, so
``stop``, a retry, or a failed handshake could leave that grandchild running —
an orphan still holding whatever port or credential it was handed. Worse,
``close()`` returned early when ``returncode is not None``, which is precisely
the case where a launcher has exited and left its tree behind.

These tests spawn real processes; each asserts on the *tree*, not on the leader.
