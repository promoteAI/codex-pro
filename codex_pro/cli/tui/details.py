"""How much of the agent's working trace the transcript shows.

Visibility is a per-section setting with four states:

- ``expanded``  — the line is shown, and its detail view opens on mount.
- ``collapsed`` — the line is shown as a one-row summary; detail on demand.
- ``lean``      — (tools only) successful read-only calls suppressed; writes/
                  exec/failures shown. An opt-in quiet mode for tools.
- ``hidden``    — the section is not mounted at all.

The sections are the three bands of trace that answer different questions:
``thinking`` (why the agent decided this), ``tools`` (what it did to the world),
``activity`` (what it is doing right now).

``hidden`` is deliberately NOT allowed to hide failures. An error is the one
trace the user cannot act on if they never see it. Same rule applies to
``lean``: a failed read is still mounted.
