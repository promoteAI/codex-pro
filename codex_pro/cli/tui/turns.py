"""TurnRegistry — the TUI's model of in-flight turns, keyed by event_id.

Why this exists (replaces the old single ``_active_event_id`` string):

The gateway assigns a fresh event_id to EVERY inbound frame and codexes it back
in an ``accepted`` frame — that includes the user's real conversation turns AND
control replies like ``/approve`` / ``/deny`` / ``/clarify``. A single global
"active id" was therefore overwritten by the approval reply's accepted frame and
by any second turn the user queued, so Ctrl+C interrupted the wrong turn and the
approval prompt (a redundant is_final text) prematurely ended the original turn.

This registry distinguishes two kinds of outstanding work:

* **primary** turns — real conversation turns. These are what the timer tracks
  and what Ctrl+C must interrupt. The gateway serializes them per session
  (FIFO), so the one actually running is the oldest outstanding id.
* **control** events — approve/deny/clarify acks. They get accepted frames and
  final replies too, but must never become the interrupt target and must never
  stop the primary turn's timer.

Correlation is exact because a single WS connection delivers ``accepted`` frames
strictly in send order (the server emits each one inline in its read loop before
reading the next frame). So a FIFO of the kinds we sent lines up 1:1 with the
accepted frames we receive. Interrupt frames are excluded on purpose — their
accepted carries no event_id and never reaches the sink, so they are not
recorded here.

        dropped (recovered only as display text via replay_missed_reply, which
        carries no event_id). So after a reconnect none of the outstanding ids
        can ever be retired by an incoming frame — leaving them here would pin
        has_active_primary True forever and the queue-guard would block every
