# tests/test_gateway_dns_rebinding.py
"""Closing DNS rebinding at the Gateway HTTP/WS boundary.

The cross-site Origin/Sec-Fetch-Site check is not enough on its own. A
DNS-rebinding page sends ``Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`` — and that is *correct
from the browser's point of view*: the page that made the request did share
the same scheme/host/port as itself. The Origin is also consistent (it is the
attacker's own page origin), and the Host is whatever the page's URL was. After
rebind, that Host resolves to 127.0.0.1 — so the gateway sees a same-origin
browser request from a loopback peer, and grants the loopback exemption.

The defense is that the Host must name a host this gateway was *intended* to
be reached on: a loopback name (``localhost`` / ``127.0.0.1`` / ``[::1]``) when
bound to loopback, an explicitly listed reverse-proxy domain otherwise. Origin
vs Host is not enough — both are attacker-controlled the moment DNS rebinds.
