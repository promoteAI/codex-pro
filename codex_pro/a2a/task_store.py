"""Bounded, TTL-based store for A2A tasks.

A2AProtocol used a plain unbounded dict for tasks, so completed tasks lived
forever and a long-running server leaked memory without limit. This store
keeps terminal tasks (completed/failed/canceled) around for a TTL window so
tasks/get can still fetch a recent result, then reclaims them. Active tasks are
immune to the normal result TTL and capacity eviction, but a generous active
backstop requests cancellation through the protocol so stuck work cannot live
forever. No persistence: on restart the store is empty, which matches the
existing in-memory semantics.
