"""Event-loop watchdog — detect a frozen asyncio loop and self-heal via exit.

The gateway runs a single asyncio event loop; any synchronous blocking call on
that loop thread (e.g. an unbounded ``rglob``/``read_text``) starves every other
task — channel polling, the HTTP health endpoint, other sessions. When that
happens nothing on the loop can observe it, because the observer coroutine is
itself starved.

Strategy (do NOT try to "unfreeze" the loop — impossible from outside a thread
stuck in a C call): a cheap heartbeat coroutine stamps ``_last_beat`` on the
loop; a **daemon thread** (which keeps running because blocking syscalls release
the GIL) checks how stale that stamp is. Past ``warn_seconds`` it logs + dumps
tracebacks; past ``kill_seconds`` it dumps and calls ``os._exit`` so the process
manager (launchd KeepAlive / systemd Restart=always) respawns a clean process.

Why this is safe to auto-exit: the heartbeat only stops advancing when the loop
is *actually blocked*. Any normal ``await`` (a 120s model stream, a git clone)
still yields to the heartbeat, so ``kill_seconds`` (default 30s) effectively
only fires on pathological synchronous-blocking, which is the very bug we hit.

Known limitation: a pure-Python busy loop that never releases the GIL would also
stall this daemon thread. That case is rare; the common offender is blocking
I/O, which releases the GIL and lets the watchdog run.
