# tests/test_worker_security_context_inheritance.py
"""A delegated worker must not reach further than whoever dispatched it.

The worker executor (agent/tools/delegate.py) runs each worker tool call through
the real ApprovalGate, but used to call it with ``channel=""`` and
``event=None``. Both are lies about the caller:

  - ``""`` is in ``ApprovalGate._INTERACTIVE_CHANNELS``, so the gate read it as a
    local human-at-the-keyboard session and applied ``cli_auto_approve``. A
    worker's ``exec`` was therefore auto-approved even when the parent call came
    from telegram and would itself have required consent — delegating a command
    was a cheaper route to running one than running it.
  - ``event=None`` dropped ``unattended`` / ``cron_authorized``, the two typed
    trust fields on InboundEvent. A scheduled job's worker looked interactive
    rather than unattended, so the per-job authorization that gates the job's own
    work did not gate its worker's work.

The dispatch is gated too (delegate_task/spawn_task are EXEC-tier), but that only
bounds who may dispatch; it says nothing about what the worker may then do. These
tests pin the inheritance itself.

They call the gate the way the worker executor does, rather than driving a real
LLM worker loop: the security decision is what is under test, and routing it
through a live provider would test the provider.
