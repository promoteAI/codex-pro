"""Installer / default-config startability regressions.

The shipped defaults used to combine into a gateway that could not start:
``host: 0.0.0.0`` (schema) + empty ``auth.apiTokens`` (schema) + gateway forced
on by the ``gateway`` entrypoint, against a ``_check_bind_safety`` that refuses
a non-loopback bind with no token. A quickstart install never visits the gateway
section — so it never sets a token — and therefore always produced a service
that failed on every start.

The fix is the default bind address, NOT the safety check: refusing to expose an
unauthenticated agent is correct and stays. These tests pin both halves, so a
future "make it reachable out of the box" change cannot quietly delete the gate.
