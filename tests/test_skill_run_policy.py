"""Regression tests for skill_run as a governed exec path.

skill_run declared risk_level="exec" but carried no capabilities and appeared in
none of the deny lists, so it was exposed under daemon and public_gateway after
those profiles had carefully refused exec/execute_code/process — and one of the
builtin skills shipped a general-purpose shell runner reachable through it.
tools.exec.enabled=false did not stop it either, and a single "approve always"
covered every script of every skill.

These tests pin each of those holes shut.
