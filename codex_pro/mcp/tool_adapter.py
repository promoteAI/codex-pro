        MCP ``ToolAnnotations`` are hints supplied by the server, and the
        specification is explicit that clients must not treat them as
        trustworthy for security decisions when the server is untrusted. The
        previous implementation let ``readOnlyHint: true`` map straight to
        ``READ_ONLY``, and ``ApprovalGate`` passes READ_ONLY and WRITE without
        asking anyone — so any server could self-declare its delete/transfer/
        upload tool as read-only and skip EXEC approval entirely. The hint was
        doing the one job it is documented as unfit for.

        So trust is now a property of the *server*, set by the operator in
        config, and never of the payload:

        * ``untrusted`` (default) — floor of EXEC, i.e. a human approves the
          first call. A ``destructiveHint`` still escalates to DANGEROUS;
          ``readOnlyHint`` is ignored, because a claim that lowers the gate is
          exactly the claim an attacker would make.
        * ``trusted`` — the operator has vouched for this server, so hints are
          honoured in both directions and behave as documented.

        Malformed annotations (non-dict, non-boolean fields) never relax
        anything: they fall through to the floor.
