    """Classify the risk level of a tool call — the STRICTER of the two sources.

    The static map and a tool's declared ``risk_level`` describe the same fact,
    so whenever they disagree one of them is stale. Letting the map win
    unconditionally (the previous rule) meant a tool could declare
    ``risk_level="exec"`` and still be gated as WRITE forever, with nothing to
    surface the contradiction — that is how delegate_task/spawn_task became a
    cheaper path to EXEC than exec itself, despite both declaring "exec".

    Taking the maximum severity makes a stale entry fail safe rather than fail
    open: it can over-gate a call (visible, someone complains) but can no longer
    silently under-gate one. A tool that genuinely needs to be *less* restricted
    than its declaration has to say so by changing the declaration.

    Falls back to WRITE when neither source knows the tool.
