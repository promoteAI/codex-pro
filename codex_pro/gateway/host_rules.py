"""Bind-address and Host-header classification — one set of rules, four callers.

Four places used to decide "is this bind address local?" independently, and
they disagreed on exactly the values that matter:

  - ``server.py:_check_bind_safety`` compared the string against a literal
    tuple that included ``""``, so an empty host counted as loopback and an
    unauthenticated gateway was allowed to start — but ``asyncio``/aiohttp
    bind ``""`` to ``0.0.0.0`` *and* ``::``, i.e. every interface. That was an
    unauthenticated network exposure.
  - ``server.py:_warn_host_allowlist_if_unset`` used ``ipaddress`` instead, so
    it disagreed with the check above on ``""`` (wildcard here, loopback
    there) and on ``127.0.0.2`` (loopback here, exposed there).
  - ``auth.py:_bound_is_loopback`` reached into ``cli.runtime_probe`` for the
    wildcard tuple and did not strip IPv6 brackets, so ``[::1]`` — the shape
    the value actually takes in a Host header — classified as non-loopback.
  - the setup wizard kept its own copy of the string tuple, inheriting the
    ``""`` bug and rejecting ``127.0.0.2``.

This module is the single answer. It lives under ``gateway/`` because the rules
are the gateway's, and it depends on nothing but the stdlib — no config schema,
no server, no aiohttp — so the setup wizard can share the rules while holding
only a raw, possibly hand-edited YAML dict, long before any server exists.
