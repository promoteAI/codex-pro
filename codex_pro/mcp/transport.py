"""MCP transports — stdio and Streamable HTTP for JSON-RPC communication.

Two transports, both speaking the framing that MCP 2025-06-18 specifies:

* :class:`StdioTransport` — newline-delimited JSON over a child process's
  stdin/stdout.
* :class:`StreamableHttpTransport` — POST for client→server, with responses
  arriving either as a direct JSON body or as an SSE stream, plus an optional
  long-lived GET stream for server→client traffic.

The legacy ``HttpTransport`` (an HTTP+SSE client for the pre-2025-03-26
revision) used to live here. It was never constructed by the manager — only by
its own tests — and it carried the same framing bugs as the code below, so
keeping it meant maintaining two transports to fix one. It is gone; the
Streamable HTTP transport is the only HTTP path.

    """MCP Streamable HTTP transport (2025-06-18).

    What the previous implementation got wrong, all of it observable against the
    official Python SDK:

    * **No ``Accept`` header.** The spec requires every POST to send
      ``Accept: application/json, text/event-stream``. Without it a compliant
      server answers 406.
    * **No HTTP status check.** That 406's JSON-RPC error body was pushed onto
      the response queue with an id the client had never issued, so no pending
      future matched and the call ran to its full timeout. A protocol error
      surfaced as a hang.
    * **LF-only SSE framing.** Events were split on ``\\n\\n``, but SSE permits
      ``\\r\\n\\r\\n`` and the official SDK emits it — so the parser never
      produced a single event against a real server.
    * **No ``MCP-Protocol-Version``**, no GET stream for server-initiated
      traffic, no session re-initialisation after a 404, no DELETE on shutdown.

    Each of those is fixed below. One deliberate design note: POSTs are no longer
    serialised behind a single lock. The lock existed to protect session-id and
    queue ordering, but it also serialised every concurrent tool call on a
    JSON-responding server. Ordering is instead protected where it belongs — the
    session id is assigned under a narrow lock, and the response queue is
    inherently order-independent because JSON-RPC correlates by request id.
