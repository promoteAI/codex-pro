"""Build the Codex Pro web UI on demand, rather than during installation.

install.sh used to build the frontend up front. That made a working pnpm/Node
toolchain a prerequisite of *installing an agent*, and when it failed the user
got one grey warn line mid-scroll followed by a green "Installation Complete"
banner and a web UI URL that served a stripped-down playground instead. The
installer was promising something it already knew was untrue.

Building here instead means the failure lands the moment the user asks for the
Dashboard — when they are present, their intent is unambiguous, and the
diagnosis is worth reading. It also keeps the artifact matched to the checked-out
code, which fetching a pre-built bundle from a release would not.

`pip install codex-pro` users are unaffected: hatch_build.py bundles web/dist
into the wheel, GatewayServer._resolve_web_dir finds it first, and
find_web_dir() returns None here so nothing in this module runs.
