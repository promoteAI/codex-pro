"""Knowledge rebuild single-flight — two concurrent calls must coalesce.

Reviewer P2 (file review): ``rebuild_async`` crosses ``await`` points, so the
``threading.Lock`` that protected the synchronous halves let two concurrent
callers race on the vector sidecar. The fix is an ``asyncio.Lock`` plus a
shared future: the second caller joins the first rebuild and gets the same
result instead of starting a parallel backfill.

The race is data-integrity, not a performance issue: A could write a sidecar
based on a stale snapshot of ``self._chunks`` while B was already mid-write,
silently losing a chunk or two. Verifying it directly requires mocking the
embedding path so both calls are paused at the same await point.
