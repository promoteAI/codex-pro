"""Gateway runtime state — the single source of truth for "is the gateway
actually usable right now".

Three places used to answer this question independently: status.py probed
endpoint file + TCP + service state, setup's doctor read only the YAML (and so
printed a ✓ for a gateway nobody was serving), and attach_client hardcoded a
`systemctl` suggestion that is wrong on WSL without systemd. They disagreed.
This module is the one answer all three now call.

Read-only and non-raising by contract: it runs on the failure path of
`codex-pro cli`, where the user is already stuck. Any sub-probe that fails
degrades to "unknown" rather than adding a traceback on top.
