"""Authoritative workspace resolution and gateway runtime-endpoint helpers.

Historically each entrypoint resolved a relative ``workspace: ./data`` on its
own: ``app.bootstrap`` resolved it against the *config file's* directory, while
``plugin``/``checkpoint``/``migrate`` resolved it against the *shell cwd*. The
same config then landed in different directories depending on which command ran.

:func:`resolve_effective_workspace` is the single rule every entrypoint must
call. The runtime-endpoint functions are the shared contract between the
gateway (writer) and ``attach``/``service status`` (readers): the actually bound
port only ever surfaced on stdout, so anything that didn't parse the log could
not learn the real port when ``gateway.port=0``.
