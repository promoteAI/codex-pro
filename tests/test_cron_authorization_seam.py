# tests/test_cron_authorization_seam.py
"""The seam between the authorization layer and the approval gate.

Two suites already existed either side of it: test_cron_authorization_bypass
mutates ScheduledJob objects and checks fingerprint semantics, while
test_approval_gate_e2e hand-builds InboundEvents and checks gate decisions. Both
were green while the feature as a whole did nothing — the gate waved every
unattended WRITE through above the per-job check, so no grant was ever consulted
for write_file / edit_file / patch / memory / notify, and the cron_authorized
WRITE branch was unreachable code.

These tests span the join instead: a job as stored → delivery.inbound_event_from_job
→ ApprovalGate.check. That is the only path where "a grant actually gates
privileged work" is a testable claim.
