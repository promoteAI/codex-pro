"""Tests for the skills-inventory token budget in the system prompt.

The skill list is injected into *every* turn's system prompt. The 35 bundled
skills already cost ~1.2k tokens unbounded; a user with a few hundred installed
would have handed a fixed five-figure token tax to every single request, and the
entries squeezed out would have been whatever sorted last — silently.

The budget degrades in two stages: truncate descriptions first (a shortened
description still identifies a skill well enough for the model to call
skill_view), then drop entries while *saying* how many were dropped, because an
unannounced omission would make the model confidently assert a skill does not
exist.
