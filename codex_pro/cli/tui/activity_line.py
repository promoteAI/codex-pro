"""Live activity line — the row that says what the agent is doing NOW, and how
the last turn ended.

Replaces the in-transcript heartbeat block. That block was mounted into the
scrollback keyed by ``inbound_event_id``, so its position was fixed at the
moment the first heartbeat arrived while tool lines kept appending *below* it:
the "still working" notice ended up above content that had already finished,
which reads backwards. It also carried a randomly rotating reassurance phrase
("马上就好" / "还在跑" / …) that conveyed nothing and re-rendered on every beat.

Docked directly above the input row, this line is unambiguously about the
present: it names the current phase (and the running tool when there is one),
counts in-flight tools, and shows the turn's own elapsed clock.

It then SETTLES rather than disappearing. Hiding the row on completion made the
only moving thing on screen vanish along with the elapsed clock, and the row
collapsed to zero height — so a finished turn and a hung one looked identical
("it was scrolling, then it just stopped"). Worse, all four end paths (reply,
gateway error, disconnect, reconnect) called the same ``stop()``, so success and
failure were visually equivalent. Now the row keeps one quiet terminal line
naming the outcome, its duration and what it did, and only clears when the next
turn starts (or ``reset()`` on /clear). Idle-from-boot still renders nothing, so
a fresh screen ends at the last real content.

``render_text`` is a pure function of the widget's state plus an injected
``now``, so the whole display is unit-testable without a live screen — matching
the convention in blocks.py.
