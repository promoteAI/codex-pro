# tests/test_risk_classifier_consistency.py
"""The static risk map and each tool's declared risk_level must not disagree.

Both describe one fact — "how dangerous is calling this tool" — and the gate
reads them through classify_risk(). While the map won unconditionally, a
disagreement was invisible and permanent: DelegateTool/SpawnTool declared
risk_level="exec" and were gated as WRITE anyway, which made delegating a
command a cheaper route to EXEC than running one. Nothing failed; the two
sources simply drifted.

These tests are the fence. The first pins the specific escalation that was
exploitable, the second is the general property so a future tool cannot
reintroduce the same class of hole by adding a map entry that is weaker than
what the tool itself claims.
