"""Convenience helper for skill scripts to ensure their dependencies.

Usage in any skill script:

    # At the top of the script, before importing optional packages:
    from codex_pro.dependencies.skill_require import require
    require("skill.excel-author")

    # Now safe to import:
    from openpyxl import Workbook

This replaces the old try/except ImportError pattern with a single call
that handles detection, user prompting, installation, and clear error
messages.

Behavior varies by environment:
- TTY (CLI): prompt user to confirm install, sys.exit on failure
- Non-TTY (channel/daemon): auto-install if allowed by config; on failure,
  print a user-friendly message to stdout (so the agent can relay it to
  the channel user) and exit with code 0 to avoid crashing the skill runner
