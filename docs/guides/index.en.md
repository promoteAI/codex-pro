## Overview

Codex Pro combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models with an orchestrable tool system, delivering a complete Agent runtime. The sections here are organized by functional domain:

- **Model Layer**: Configure one or more LLM backends with support for OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, and other providers.
- **Tool Layer**: Declare which tools the Agent can invoke, and control scope and rate through permission policies.
- **Execution Layer**: Choose where code and commands run — local processes, Docker containers, or remote sandboxes.
- **Extended Capabilities**: Browser automation, media processing, and knowledge base retrieval give the Agent richer perception and action.
- **State Management**: The memory system and session management ensure context coherence across multi-turn, multi-session scenarios.
- **Scheduling & Monitoring**: Scheduled jobs, the web UI, and cost controls help you run Agents safely and efficiently in production.

!!! tip "Suggested Reading Order"
    If you just finished installation, start with [Model Integration](models/index.en.md), then read [Tools & Permissions](tools-permissions.en.md) to understand the Agent's action boundaries.
