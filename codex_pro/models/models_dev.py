"""models.dev integration — live per-model context-window database.

models.dev (https://models.dev/api.json) is a community-maintained catalog of
4000+ models across 100+ providers. Each model carries a ``limit.context`` —
its real context window. We use it as a dynamic resolution layer so a model
that ships after this build still resolves to its true window without a code
change, instead of falling back to a hardcoded default.

Design constraints (measured: the api.json fetch is ~3MB / ~14s from CN):
  * ``lookup_context`` is a hot-path helper called from the (synchronous)
    window resolver — it MUST NOT block on the network. It only ever reads the
    in-memory / on-disk cache and returns 0 on a miss.
  * The network fetch runs fire-and-forget in a daemon thread, triggered when
    the cache is empty or stale. The first caller on a cold, cache-less install
    gets 0 (the built-in registry covers that round); the refresh fills the
    cache so subsequent rounds resolve against real data.

No bundled snapshot ships with the package — the on-disk cache under
``~/.codex-pro/cache/models_dev.json`` is the offline-first store, written
after the first successful fetch.
