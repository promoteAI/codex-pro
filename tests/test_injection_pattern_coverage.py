"""Coverage tests for the prompt-injection pattern itself.

The English rule required a single qualifier directly adjacent to
"instructions", so it matched "ignore previous instructions" but missed
"ignore **all** previous instructions" — the canonical phrasing — along with
every variant carrying filler words. The Chinese rule already allowed
interstitial words; the two are now symmetric.

Both directions are pinned here: real phrasings must match, and ordinary English
that happens to contain "ignore" must not. A false positive in this scan blocks a
legitimate memory write or skill install, so the benign list matters as much as
the attack list.
